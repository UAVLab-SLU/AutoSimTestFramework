i want to test in high temparature and  no wind involvement senarios,"Conducting training flight as instructor pilot in an unmanned Aircraft X. Tower weather per 
ATIS was reported as Few clouds 1100 ft. Prior to that, skies had been reported as clear. 
Took off planning on VFR pattern work and found that the clouds had thicke ned and 
pushed in. Decision was made and communicated to tower that we would make a full stop 
landing. VFR cloud clearances were not maintained at times during the pattern. Full stop 
landing was successfully completed after which Tower stated that clouds w ere now Broken 
at 1200 ft. AGL.The DJI Matrice 210 small unmanned aircraft was being operated commercially to record 
video footage of an outdoor athletics event.  The pilot started to position the aircraft back 
towards the landing site due to an increase in the rainfall.  The pilot then saw the aircraft 
“wobble” slightly and as it neared the landing site it flipped over before descending rapidly to 
the ground from a height of about 3 m (10 ft).  No one was injured.  During the accident flight 
the aircraft had been operating at heights of up to about 30 m (100 ft) near to, and above 
people on the ground.  This investigation reviewed other similar accidents and the risk of 
injury to people on the ground.  Two Safety Recommendations are made to the UK CAA.Whilst the unmanned aircraft (UA) was climbing, in hover mode, one of the rear electronic 
speed controllers (ECSs) overheated causing a loss of control of its associated motor and 
propeller.  Control of the aircraft was lost and it fell into a crop field, damaging it beyond 
economical repair.  The manufacturer is looking to re-design the rear propellers to reduce 
the likelihood of the ESCs overheating.During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public.The UA was hovering at between 50 m to 65 m agl during a demonstration flight, when a 
rhythmic, lower than normal sound was heard emanating from the UAS.  It then dipped 
and spiralled downwards during which control could not be re-established.  The UA hit the 
ground and was severely damaged.  A fatigue failure of a blade attachment bolt caused one 
of the lift propeller blades to detach in flight."," Scenario 1:
