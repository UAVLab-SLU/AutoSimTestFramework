'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 2}","I was operating my UAS on a mapping mission with a base station for RTK (Real -Time 
Kinematic Positioning) corrections. I was running an automated mapping mission using the 
KMZ file using the app. This was my first operation of the KMZ file as opposed to a KML 
file. As per the KMZ file, I was having the mission fly to remain no more than 400 feet AGL 
to the terrain, and in order to maintain a visual line of sight I would move throughout the 
hilled/undeveloped area in order to maintain VLOS. I would have to r emove the cap on the 
application in order to allow the drone to fly the 400 feet AGL over the hilled areas. This 
mission became lengthy as I would return to the home start point, move a few hundred 
feet to a good vantage point that would keep a VLOS, then start the drone and move with 
it. I would then have to return the drone to home and I came along with it, which proved 
to be fatiguing. Part of this fatigue was caused by me being hypervigilant to the nearby 
airport, as there were airplanes practicing land ings/touch and gos, (across the highway, 
but still closeby) and I wanted to ensure no airplanes were moving towards the south 
(towards me). Towards the end of the mission, the drone began the return to home. 
During this the drone began to rise to 1000 ft. I was keeping visual line of sight directly 
and realized it was becoming increasingly difficult to see. I looked at the remote and 
realized it was at 1000 ft AGL. I then ceased the operation, and took manual control and 
brought the drone down as quickly as  possible. Upon investigating the issue, I soon 
realized that because I set the return to home safely at 1000 feet, the drone automatically 
went to that height. My error was not setting it at the 400 feet that I normally set it to. I 
set the max altitude i n the application to 1000 feet, in order to move along the hillsides. 
(this height would only happen in relation to the altitude). This was also my first operation 
in a hilled/varying terrain area which added another layer of difficulty. I mostly run 
mappi ng missions on smaller flatter terrain. For future flights with varying terrain areas, I 
will set the return to home altitude no more than 250 feet, which is one of the highest 
points in the area above my start point. I will also manually fly the drone hom e at a much

inspections. This afternoon, my 
boss and another coworker took the drone from my possession to do perspective photos 
and overview photos without me, despite my warning about airspace and drone pilo t 
regulations. During the conversation it was stated that I had to remain at the office to 
meet with the business owner. They called me at XA:49 to ask how to place the drone into 
manual mode. I again reminded them that the airspace in the area of the road  is known to 
me to have special flight restrictions and that is a violation to fly without a licensed pilot 
but was told it's just for a few photos. Upon returning, they admitted to me that he had

Pilot failed to maintain disciplined pre -flight check for jump resulting 
in exceeding altitude limit (130.1m). After launching 2nd jump of UAS practice, pilot 
discovered the remote system had logged out of account for flying app (DJ I) - causing a 
limit of 30m altitude. Pilot landed to inspect the issue, and began the process of logging 
back in. This disrupted normal mental progression of flight operation, resulting in 
unintentional manipulation of control settings for UAS including A ltitude max and distance 
max. Pilot exceeded the altitude limits in subsequent jump. The jump in question 
completed after roughly 15min, with no damage, no danger of mid air collision with other 
air crafts.

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 10}","On Day 0 I conducted two UAS flights in two different locations. Each flight lasted less 
than 5 minutes, the purpose of each flight to collect 2 -3 birdseye images at each location. 
Upon arriving at the first location I checked airspace on B4UFly, received the all -clear, and 
conducted the flight without incident. When I arrived at the second location I again 
checked B4UFly, saw the all -clear and conducted the flight. I flew straight up to a height 
just below 400 feet, collected 2 images and flew straight dow n, being in the air for less 
than 3 -5 minutes. After the flight, I turned my mobile device back on and noticed that the 
B4UFly app was now showing that I was just inside an area of controlled airspace (+/ - 
0.25 miles from the outermost edge of the airspace ). Upon further investigation I 
discovered that when I loaded the app at the second location it had not updated my 
location and the ""all -clear"" that I saw was remaining from the previous flight's location. 
After opening my mobile device the second time, th e app had updated and was showing 
me just inside of the controlled airspace area. The important take -aways from this 
experience have been to pay closer attention to the details when checking airspace,

When returned to home location (a floating dock), the drone refused to 
descend when commanded with down left stick on the remote controller. I ended up using 
the Return -to-home (RTH) button. Laterally, the drone only needed to move a few  feet.

Instrument Rating. What: 
UAS Engine Out Event. Why: The RPM of the Engine suddenly dropped to zero mid -flight 
and an emergency landing was executed at ZZZ on Runway X, resulting in the successf ul 
recovery of all aircraft components. Once recovered, the engine was found to have 
significant compression loss. Note that, the UAS engine can only be started from the 
ground. Root Cause Analysis Findings: Debris entering the intake valve guide. Large 
exhaust valve gap clearance. Intake Valve became stuck in the open position.  
Callback: 1

I am in good health. I'm not a smoker. I had a good night's sleep 
and was hydrated. I stood in the middle of the flight area and could easily see the UAS at 
all times. I arrived around XA:00 and walked the area to be mapped and chos e a spot near 
the middle of the mission area that had great visibility to set up home and battery 
exchange point. Conditions: I utilized the Aloft app (v2.2.2.XXXX) stated the flight weather 
as: 64F wind at 7 from North gusting to 17 with visibility greate r than 10. ALOFT showed 
no advisories for the location with a green zero box. Utilizing the DJI pilot app (V2.5.1.XX), 
in mission flight mode. The flight altitude for the mission was 138' AGL of home point. The 
total area of the mission was 32.0 acres and an estimated time of 55m and 1 sec. The 
estimated flight time means that the UAS returns to home point for battery exchange 
about every 15 minutes. How it was noticed: I was watching the UAS and thought it came 
to hover as it finished flying waypoints prio r to returning to the home point. At that point it 
looked down at the controller to see if it was complete and noticed caution that the UAS 
was not connected. I looked up and the UAS was no longer in the air. I walked over and 
found the UAS in the field wi th damage to two arms and approximately 15 feet away I 
found the battery that had expanded and separated on one side of its casing. No battery 
materiel leakage or seepage was visible. It is my belief that the gust wind conditions 
required the UAS to utiliz e increased rate of battery power draw, the battery expanded 
causing the UAS to lose power resulting in an uncontrolled descent/fall from the sky into 
the field. No property was damaged, and no fire occurred. Management was in the final set 
of purchasing a  MAVIC 3 to meet the remote identification requirement and upgrades us 
with multispectral capability. Because of this, management made a decision to utilize the

Q83 airway I had a near 
miss with what I thought to be a drone at 21,800 ft. I was headed southbound and the 
drone was headed northbound. I just looked up for a second and I saw a black and si lver

I took my new UAS out to 
get familiar with it and to try to take pictures of Location A. I relied on DJI's built -in app to 
avoid restricted or warning airspace. The app allowed me to fly up t o 200 feet north of 
Airforce Base at a spot it called an ""warning zone"" with an ""altitude zone"" of 60m, and the 
DJI Fly App allowed me to fly the drone to 60m without prior authorization through LAANC. 
However, as I was leaving, officials pulled up and ask ed me if I was flying a drone they 
detected on their surveillance system. I said yes and they asked me if I realized I was 
flying in Class B airspace. I said no, I was flying where the app allowed me to but not 
inside the geo -fenced area further south (clo ser to the airfield). They said I was still in the 
Class B airspace from surface to 10000 ft MSL. I apologized and told them I would be sure 
to stay out of the Class B airspace in the future. What I'm concerned about is that the DJI 
software allows the dro nes to fly in Class B airspace even when it starts at the surface. 
This oversight in the software will continue to contribute to drones flying in close proximity

from an Aerial Surveying 
Mission. While Direct Paradise VOR and 11.9 Miles heading 073 from F70 we had an 
extremely close call with a UAS aircraft. A black hexagonal sphere -like multi -rotor dro ne 
came within a few feet of our right wing. No ATC warning was given and no NOTAM ’s for 
UAV flight were posted. Drones should carry a version of ADSB at high altitudes.  
Callback: 1

set the maximum 
altitude to 196 feet on my controller instead of my intended 98 feet. I climbed to max 
altitude. Looking at my UA I thought that seems high for here. I checked and saw my 
altitude. I immediately descend to below 100 AGL and continued my flight. No other 
aircraft were in the area. At no time was safety an issue I just inadvertently exceeded my

travels as we go. We 
came upon an anchorage that I wanted to get some video of, right as we were passing a 
large tow boat with multiple barges. Between monitoring my wife at the helm, stayi ng 
cognizant of the passing tow, and my haste to get the drone in the air before the 
opportunity passed - I neglected to check my preflight apps for any airspace restrictions. 
As it turn out, I was flying the drone in the far northeast reaches of ZZZ's air space. There 
were no air traffic conflicts that I am aware of. My DJI remote gave no indication that I 
was about to operate close to an airport (I do not use it as a sole source, also B4UFly and 
AutoPylot). I discovered my mistake on AutoPylot afterward, a nd also found that LAANC 
Auto Approval is not active for that airport. Task saturation and self -imposed time 
limitations were major factors, as well as complacency as there had been no airspace 
restrictions in the past 90 miles of our travels. Going forwar d, I will place higher priority on

stadium on Day 0. I had 
checked the sectional chart prior to take off and my interpretation was that the stadium 
was outside of the class C airspace for ZZZ. So I proceeded as normal and began my  flight 
with my UAS. The app also did not inform me that I was within in sort of controlled 
airspace and allowed me to take off as normal. I flew for approximately 8 minutes in and 
around the stadium, capturing video for the wedding couple. After I conclud ed my flight I 
was informed by the event staff that the police had been notified and they had came over 
to stop me for flying. I was then informed that I was not permitted to fly because of the 
helicopter pads nearby for the hospitals. After that, I later figured out that the stadium is 
also indeed right on the edge of the class C airspace for ZZZ. Going forward I now am

Airspace. Since my drone is 
set in meters, it didn't translate to me at the time that I was flying above 400 ft AGL. 
Since I knew I was in uncontrolled airspace Class G from my sectional chart, I  thought I 
was clear as long as I stayed in Class G. However, as noted in the Advisory Circular, I was 
not allowed to fly above 400 ft AGL. In Class G, it is as if my drone has an imaginary 
string extending 400 feet - I needed to be within 400 feet of some thing terrestrial, and I 
was not, thus causing an Altitude Violation. All rules always apply - I now realize that even 
if I am in Class G, I must stay below 400 ft AGL (in relation to something terrestrial). I

movement portion of the 
taxi out. We perform all of the ground operation on a ramp on the southwest corner of the 
airport at the end of [the] taxiway. The airport has a gate that is blocking t axiway and the 
crew was briefed that this is a non movement area behind the gate on [the] taxi way. We 
began our taxi up to and holding short of the gate remaining outside the movement area 
to our knowledge. Ground asked who approved us to taxi? We briefed  them that we were 
told this was a non movement area and they said that we needed permission to taxi. 
There is no movement lines that we observed and we thought the gate was the boundary 
to the movement area. There should be a clear defined visual boundary  to the movement 
and non movement area.

The reporter indicated ATC did not issue a brasher warning. In the ramp area where the 
UAS is operated there are no markings on the ramp to delineate between the non

approximately 300 ft. and 30 kts, 
the right seat pilot (pilot monitoring) observed an quad copter type drone off our nose 
(20-30 ft.) and slightly below (20 ft.) moving right to left. Shortly after seeing the drone

After being handed off from ZZZ Center to PHL approach, and 
before checking in, we experienced a near miss with a small aircraft or drone. Our attitude 
was six thousand feet. We were approximately thirty miles south of PHL. The First O fficer 
and I happened to be looking outside at the time and were both startled by the 
appearance of a small silver colored craft with wings, co -altitude with excessive closure. I 
estimate the closure was 300 knots. The craft appeared in my peripheral visio n at about 
the one oclock position and passed directly off our right wing by roughly 50 feet. The 
encounter lasted for perhaps only one or two seconds. When I checked in with PHL 
approach, I reported the sighting whereupon the controller instructed me to c all on 
landing. I did so and reported the event to Person A at TRACON. In accordance with the 
FOM, I called dispatch the next day and spoke to the shift manager and an Assistant Chief 
Pilot (ACP). The ACP asked me to fill out a general safety form and prov ide these details.  
Narrative: 2  
Flying XXXX from ZZZ to PHL. I was the First Officer (FO) and Pilot Flying (PF). We were 
flying the PAATS4 RNAV arrival with the autopilot engaged. I believe we were level at 
6,000 ft. MSL near CANNY intersection when the Captain said, ""what's that?"". I lo oked up 
and he pointed to an object off our right side at our same altitude. We were flying at 
approximately 250 KIAS so it zoomed past us rather quickly. The object appeared to be 
either a large drone or a small aircraft. Its color was white or light grey . I'd estimate its 
distance from us to be around 200 meters but it's difficult to say for sure. We did not 
receive any TCAS TA or RA or any warning from ATC about traffic. The Captain was Pilot 
Monitoring (PM) and reported the object to PHL Tracon via voic e radio. He was also given a

While flying below the MCO Bravo, my passenger who is 
not a pilot, called out an aircraft quickly closing at our 2 O'clock. We both identified a 4 
rotor drone, similar to a consumer DJI model, about 1/4 NM off our right win g and slightly 
higher. I could not tell if the drone was stationary or moving. There was a commercial 
aircraft approaching approximately 1,500 ft. higher than the drone and descending. I 
quickly took a picture of my EFB to capture the location. The commerc ial aircraft 
mentioned earlier was approaching final at MCO. I immediately dialed up MCO Approach 
and once I raised the controller I shared the information about the drone sighting. The

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 73}","I flew from ZZZ1 to ZZZ on IFR flight plan in late August. I was cleared to ZZZ by the 
ground controller at ZZZ1. En route I checked NOTAMS on the Garmin G1000 and saw 
nothing indicating any alert situation at the airport. I was put on vectors by ZZZ appro ach 
as I neared the ZZZ VOR and then handed off to ZZZ1 Approach. As ZZZ1 approach 
issued a clearance for the visual to land at ZZZ, I cancelled the IFR plan and proceeded 
VFR. At no point through this --my initial clearance to ZZZ, my check of notams en ro ute, 
or my clearance for the approach was I notified that the airport had been closed by the 
authorities for drone operations. I made the usual traffic calls on the CTAF frequency as I 
flew a normal left downwind pattern for landing. On landing I noticed a  car with lights on 
at the approach end of the runway, but I had remembered seeing a notice the day before 
indicating that there was work being done at the end of the runway and these lights were 
consistent with that notice and I landed long. Upon landing I saw several police cars on 
the property and was notified by an officer that I had just landed at a closed airport. He 
said a NOTAM had been issued closing the airport and asked if I had seen it. I said, no, 
and that I had only seen a notice saying (I tho ught) that there was work being done at the 
end of the runway, but no notice of closure. He asked if I had checked the FAA site and I 
said, no, but that i had checked foreflight and the Garmin system on the airplane. I also 
said that I was on an IFR flight  plan, had been cleared to the airport, that I had been 
cleared for a visual approach, and that I had made radio calls (suggesting of course that 
no one else knew it was closed either). He said he'd find out what was wrong. I was asked 
how long before I co uld take off, got permission to fuel the aircraft and departed about 45 
minutes later. I was never told the resolution of the investigation. I did check the NOTAMs 
when I arrived at my destination and saw that, after I landed, a NOTAM was issued for 
ZZZ cl osing the runway. The NOTAM was issued after I landed. Obviously I wished I had 
questioned more than I had the car at the airport threshold, but I also think that the police 
should have been monitoring the CTAF for cases such as mine, should have filed a t imely

feet we encountered a 
near miss with a drone. The drone flew from north to south at about 100 feet above our

I live in the middle of class D airspace with an executive airport right 
down the road. I was just up flying my DJI Avata out my back door, flying Line of Sight 
(LOS) just to run down a couple batteries so that I could put the drone up. I received Low 
Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) for a few hours today and I am 
cleared for 100 ft. Was only up less than a minute and was at 30m when the Avata started 
drifting and shot straight back into a wooded conservation are a that backs up to my back 
yard. I had absolutely no control over the Avata in just a split second, shot back into the 
woods and I lost it. I put on the [First Person View] goggles to see what was going on with 
it and apparently it hit a random tree and is  down somewhere around the middle of the 
wooded area. All I could see through the goggles was the ground, a log, and some plants 
where it has stopped. This wooded area (Swamp) will be impossible for me to try to get in 
and find it. The Avata shut down with in a minute as it said it was overheated so I can't use 
a ""find my drone"" to get it either. Do I need to now file a report with the NTSB since I lost 
radio (TX) control between the drone and myself? No injuries or damage to anything other 
that the loss of the drone.

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 81}","On Day 0, at approximately XA:00, I initiated a drone operation near Location A, with the 
aim of gaining a clearer view of a distant plume of smoke. My primary objective was to 
pinpoint the smoke's origin. I selected a mostly empty parking lot for the flig ht, ensuring 
my drone, a DJI Mini 2 weighing less than 249g, remained within my line of sight 
throughout the operation. Unfortunately, I mistakenly flew the drone to an altitude of 
about 275 feet, unintentionally surpassing the LAANC ceiling of 100 feet de signated for 
Class D airspace. At the time, I was unaware of my presence within this specific airspace. 
The clear midday conditions further compelled me to seek out the source of the smoke 
without realizing the potential violation. I was later contacted by  a local drone pilot and 
informed that my action may have been in violation of the class D airspace. I was the only 
individual manipulating the controls, and no other parties were involved in this operation. 
The breach into the Class D airspace was a direc t result of my lack of awareness about the 
regulations governing that area. After concluding the flight, a local drone enthusiast 
approached me to highlight the potential infringement. Acknowledging this oversight, I am 
now committed to improving my compre hension of UAS regulations. I am determined to 
complete the Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) and will ensure that I procure any

AGL, while on a 12 mile final to 30L, we saw a drone pass by the cockpit 
windows. We flew just underneath it. When we saw it we had no time to react. I estimate 
we were within 50 ft. of colliding with it. We advised ATC and landed withou t further 
incident. We had a Near Mid Air Collision with a drone while on final. Strict adherence to 
FARs needs to be preached to drone operators. Infractions need to be punished with 
maximum consequences. Until rogue Drone Operators are made to pay for ai rspace 
transgressions with jail time and fines this will continue. It's unbelievably unacceptable to 
fly a drone almost a mile high into the final approach corridor of one of the busiest airports 
in the US.  
Narrative: 2  
After rolling final on the ILS 30L, just past the point KLIDE at 4,000 ft. AGL, we missed a 
drone by about 50 ft. over the cockpit windows. There was no time to react after seeing it. 
We need the FAA to pursue and enforce punishments to prevent illegal dro ne operations

Carbon Cub 1300mm RTF 
from Horizon. One crashed shortly after take off after total failure. Company A replaced it, 
and the other flew several flight, and then lost it's mind. It would veer to  the right 
extremely hard, could not correct in any of the panic modes. It crashed in a huge bean

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 87}","We were flying a commercial real estate photo job and during ascent to return to home 
overhead power lines were impacted and drone was tangled in power lines. No power 
issues were apparent, and the utility company was contacted immediately. Utility company  
has confirmed the situation on -site and will retrieve UAS when a bucket truck is available. 
Remote Pilot In Command (RPIC) and Visual Observer (VO) were not communicating at 
the highest level possible, and RPIC did not accurately estimate the location of the power 
lines when ascending. Additionally, flight crew did not continue awareness after initial site 
survey and accurately assess overhead hazards. Complacency was the main contributing 
factor to this incident, and RPIC and VO have worked together for s ignificant flight hours 
and felt comfortable with past results. RPIC was not located close enough to the VO to 
receive information in a timely manner and missed the VO's verbal warning due to 
background noise in the area. VO exhibited signs of distraction and complacency as well,

reason why corrective 
actions must be taken by the pilots to avoid them. I was making the second flight of the 
day, the first and the second were real estate missions, only take photos of severa l some, 
nothing complicated, in the second mission as I was approximately 4 miles from the ZZZ 
airport I checked the normal apps such as B4UFLY and Air Control (Aloft) which did not 
show any TFR in the area on the map, request the normal authorization for a period of 2 
hours starting at approximately XA:34 local time, for about 2 hours to anticipate that the 
equipment or the wind would be very strong, finish the flight in 14 minutes and upload the 
photos again in the post work, when it was through social ne tworks that I realized the 
TFR. Taking this into consideration and how to take corrective actions, I proceeded to call 
the local FSDO inspector and two other pilots to discuss what happened, the main thing we 
can learn and the actions that should be taken is to check other applications and other 
systems like ForeFlight that give immediate updates, and any other app that shows you 
more specifically what is happening in the area, in this way to avoid this from happening 
again, I already have it written in my checklist, not to trust alone in third -party 
applications, if not also, check in the planning other pages related to this type of 
restrictions, it is something that can happen to anyone else if we are flying commercial 
missions more often, report and share  this type of experience with other pilots and help 
them increase safety actions to avoid this type of misunderstanding. When an 
authorization is obtained from these third -party applications, it does not mean 
immediately that we are authorized, corrective actions must continue to be taken and the 
action of SMS (Safety Management Systems) as a report is something that all pilots must 
take into account, in my experience as a pilot commercial and military for more than 20 
years, are things that can happen but can be avoided by increasing situational awareness, 
to avoid actions in the future, this for me is self -remedial training to avoid making these 
mistakes again, share this with the community of drone pilots within my district and 
known so that they not only  trust third -party applications but also check all other types of 
applications, web pages and aids to improve the operational safety system of the missions 
flown.

On climb out from BUF on radar 
vectors, we were climbing through 15,000 ft. 10 -15NM west of GVQ and I spotted a large 
drone as it passed a couple hundred feet to the right side of our aircraft approximatel y 300 
feet below us going the opposite direction. I did not have time to perform any avoidance 
actions. ZOB ARTCC had no indications of an aircraft in the area and it did not show up on 
TCAS. I reported the drone sighting to ZOB Center as an unknown object  and estimated it

MSL on final just prior to intercepting the glideslope for the ILS approach to 
Runway XX, we spotted a drone that was co -altitude and it rapidly passed down the left 
hand side of the our aircraft. I would estimate that it missed our left wing by less than 50 
ft. It was a black quadcopter that was rectangular and approximately one foot across the

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 100}","At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more

routine patrol over the lake 
at FL210 in conjunction with the Public Official Agency. The pilot was flying while 
monitoring an ADS -B display adjacent to the Pilot In Command (PIC) station. At 
approximately XA:03 Aircraft X received a call for aerial support for a search for a missing 
person. At this time the pilot was communicating with the ground units to move the 
aircraft into position to effectuate the search. The point of search was within the current 
clearance area for delay so no further communication with ATC was required. During this 
time a point -and-click loiter (PCL) was initiated. This was done without double checking 
the altitude settings. The PCL was set to 15,000 ft. MSL. As the aircra ft moved toward the 
area to search for the missing person the aircraft initiated a descent towards 15,000 ft. As 
comms slowed down with the ground agents, ZZZ Center called to verify Aircraft X's 
altitude. At this point the PIC edited the PCL to climb from  its current setting of 15,000 ft.

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/Drone_data/ASRS Database Report Set - Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Reports.pdf', 'page': 106}","As the Remote Pilot In Command (RPIC), I was operating a sUAS quadcopter to get photos 
on an open piece of land off the side of the road. It was daytime about midday with clear 
skies. My drone was flying in Class C Airspace without authorization which is a n FAA 
violation. The UAS was about 100 ft up when I realized that the checking of where I was 
and if airspace authorization (would typically use the B4UFLY and Aloft apps) was needed 
was missed in my pre -flight checklist. Upon the realization this step was  missed the drone 
was brought down immediately. After bringing the drone down I checked both B4UFLY and 
Aloft apps and turns out for a brief moment I was flying in class C without authorization. I 
aborted the mission called the client and told them even wi th being able to get LAANC 
auto authorization I would not be getting photos. It should be noted that no one and 
nothing was harmed or involved. No planes were in sight nor were there people flown 
over. After the incident I have reevaluated my pre -flight pl anning to involve a more 
detailed look at the process and rearrange my steps in which I take pre -flight action. With 
the small amount of flight time I have under my belt I am still getting used to everything I 
am supposed to check before flight so to corre ct this I have also revisited my Part 107 
course for a more in depth look at how to have better systems in place to avoid this in the 
future.

the exterior of a water 
tower in Location A. Pilot applied for a LAANC approval and was approved to climb up to 
100 ft. Pilot misinterpreted the LAANC approval to be measured in meters rather  than feet 
based on the FAA Visualize it website graphic. Recommendation for improvement or

Unmanned Aircraft (UA), an actor deviated from the briefed path and ran into one of the 
UA’s propellers.  The propeller struck him on the back of the neck, but the injuries were 
superficial.  
The CAA’s CAP722 document provides guidance for operating Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
(UAS) in UK airspace but is ambiguous about the UAS operator gaining explicit consent 
from involved third parties for operating in close proximity to a UA.  The CAA has taken 
action to review and amend the guidance.

about losing visual line of sight with the unmanned aircraft (UA) and attempted to activate 
the return-to-home (RTH) function.  The UA had not acquired a GPS signal prior to the flight 
and therefore did not record its takeoff point, rendering the RTH function ineffective.  The

Isle of Wight.  
The accident UAS was considerably smaller than the production aircraft but it was 
representative in terms of the avionics and communications.  It crashed shortly after taking 
off because the safety pilot switched the radio control transmitter off before the automatic

uncommanded, and lost control.  Assessment of the UAS flight data identified that an ESC 
fault caused one of the UAS’s motors to run down.  The increased load required to maintain 
the aircraft in flight depleted the battery power rapidly, resulting in the loss of control.  The

flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.

motors even though the battery’s energy level (State of Charge) was 97.7%.  The wind 
conditions were turbulent and an investigation by the Unmanned Aircraft System’s (UAS)

construction site when a GPS-compass error caused the aircraft to revert to a flight mode 
that required manual control.  By the time that the pilot and observer realised that it was 
not responding to the return-to-home (RTH) function, visual line of sight was lost when the 
aircraft drifted with the wind beyond a line of trees.  It subsequently collided with the roof of 
a house before falling into the property’s rear garden.  No persons were injured.  
The pilot, and the observer who was also a pilot, had operated UASs since 2018 and had 
the required permissions from the UK CAA.  Both pilots had relied predominantly on the 
automated flight capability of their aircraft and had not, nor were required to have, practised

stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the

started to descend.  The operator sent a command to limit the throttle but this did not 
resolve the issue.  The autopilot was in a mode whereby the throttle was used to control 
airspeed and elevator used to control altitude.  The loss of altitude caused the autopilot to 
pitch the unmanned aircraft nose-up until it stalled, entered a spin, and then hit the ground.

an immediate automatic landing. Whilst descending, its flight behaviour became erratic, 
control was lost to the remote pilot, and the UA struck an uninvolved person before hitting 
the ground. It was not possible to determine a cause for the loss of battery power or the flight

'/home/uav/Documents/AI_Hunter/LLMS/pdfs/DJI_Matrice_210_RTK_UAS_201018_11-19.pdf', 'page': 0}","The operator deployed the DJI Matrice 210 RTK unmanned aircraft system in the City 
Centre of Manchester.  Whilst the aircraft was in a static hover at 260 ft above the takeoff  
point with an estimated remaining flight time of 12 minutes and 9 seconds displayed on the 
controller, the aircraft suddenly descended and slewed sideways uncontrollably.  It hit the 
ground causing extensive damage to the airframe, batteries and cameras.  No persons or 
other property were hit by the aircraft.
Analysis confirmed that one of the batteries was indicating an erroneously high state of 
charge (SOC) and  the aircraft had initiated automatic landing due to critically low battery 
voltage.  It subsequently lost all power less than 2.5 seconds later, which resulted in an 
uncontrolled descent followed by impact with the ground.

a railway track and surrounding infrastructure when one of the four propellers detached 
whilst in-flight.  The aircraft rapidly descended from a height of 70 m (230 ft) where it struck 
the ground in the rear garden of a house.  No persons were injured.
This investigation has reviewed the new UAS regulations introduced on 31 December 2020

rhythmic, lower than normal sound was heard emanating from the UAS.  It then dipped 
and spiralled downwards during which control could not be re-established.  The UA hit the

by the UAS causing it to go into an automatic landing mode.  Seventeen seconds 
later, while the aircraft was 25 m above the ground, it powered down and the electric 
motors stopped, causing it to fall to the ground.  The batteries’ State of Charge (SOC) 
was indicating that an erroneously high amount charge remained.  The cause of the

to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind

structure of a seaside tourist attraction in Brighton.  The UA had flown several times around 
and over the top of the tower up to approximately 600 ft agl.  It had completed a shot directly 
above the tower when contact with the controller was lost.  It then descended and hit the top 
of the tower.  Its descent appeared to be under control, but the UA failed to respond to any

speed controllers (ECSs) overheated causing a loss of control of its associated motor and 
propeller.  Control of the aircraft was lost and it fell into a crop field, damaging it beyond

and uncontrollably descended, contacting the ground.  An object was seen to be released

‘low voltaGe  battery  warninG ’ appeared, all four electric motors stopped and the UAS began 
a rapid descent.  A second later the warning disappeared and the motors reactivated but 
there was insufficient time to prevent the UAS from crashing at “considerable speed”.  The

park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their

UAS causing it to enter an automatic landing mode.  Shortly afterwards, while the aircraft 
was 20 m above the ground, it powered down and the electric motors stopped, causing 
it to fall to the ground.  An investigation of this and similar accidents was conducted by 
the manufacturer which found that the batteries’ State of Charge (SOC) was indicating 
an erroneously high level of charge remaining.  Safety actions were taken by the CAA to

survey mission which involved flights of around 8 minutes duration.  As it commenced its 
pre-programmed route, it appeared to continue to climb above the 30 m height that had been 
set.  The remote pilots observed that is was too high and attempted to land it immediately.  
The aircraft appeared unresponsive to the remote pilot’s inputs and it then commenced an

Just after launch and prior 
to airborne safety checks, a “cutting noise” was heard coming from the UAS.  It then lost 
control and dropped to the ground and was severely damaged.  This was caused by one

video footage of an outdoor athletics event.  The pilot started to position the aircraft back 
towards the landing site due to an increase in the rainfall.  The pilot then saw the aircraft 
“wobble” slightly and as it neared the landing site it flipped over before descending rapidly to 
the ground from a height of about 3 m (10 ft).  No one was injured.  During the accident flight 
the aircraft had been operating at heights of up to about 30 m (100 ft) near to, and above

to its landing site, it became unresponsive and dropped to the ground.  Its motor carrier arms 
were damaged when the UA hit the ground.  The nature of the damage suggests, although 
is not conclusive, that one of the arms was not correctly locked in place.  In this condition

and transited rearwards with insufficient height to clear the 19-cm high gunwale about 2 m 
behind it.  The impact damaged the UA tail structure, leading to a failure of the tail rotor 
transmission and resulting in the UA spiralling into the sea alongside the ship.

power.  This was caused by separation of electrical connections due to thermal damage of 
the UA and battery connectors.  Damage was also found to the batteries fitted during the 
three previous flights.

stopped.  The aircraft descended on a parachute into the sea and was subsequently 
recovered.  Investigation revealed an issue with the Low Pressure fuel pump which 
caused it to fail and trip its associated electrical fuse.  This fuse also provided electrical 
power to the High Pressure fuel pump and, with both pumps stopped, the engine was 
starved of fuel.

unusual noise was heard.  Shortly afterwards one of the motors detached from the 
structure and the aircraft impacted the ground and was destroyed.  The structure showed

the electric motors stopped, despite the battery being fully charged.  The UAS struck the 
ground and was destroyed in the subsequent post-impact fire.  The UAS manufacturer 
determined that the loss of power was caused by the battery not being fully locked in place.

the unmanned aircraft to repeatedly lose control in flight until it collided with trees.  The 
aircraft was substantially damaged.  
The manufacturer has notified the five other UK owners of the Parrot Anafi USA aircraft to

a police operation.  On completion, it was being flown back to the launch point, when, 
without warning, it rapidly spiralled to the ground. It crashed into a small stream and was 
extensively damaged.  An examination of the UAS data after the accident found the cause

UAV crash landed onto train tracks on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, where it was found and retrieved by a Sydney Trains conductor in October 2013.[61] Confused platform workers inspected the UAV, with concern that it may have been a weapon.[61] The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) started an investigation, and the police began searching for the pilot.[62] The pilot was testing new UAV equipment when the camera mounting failed in mid-flight, and the UAV began to return to its GPS starting point.[61] The UAV collided with the corner of a building and then a Sydney Harbour Bridge pylon,[62] and the pilot presumed it to have been lost to the waters of Port Jackson.[61] After seeing media stories of a ""mystery drone"" colliding with the nearby bridge, the pilot contacted

triathlete was injured in an incident involving a drone that was filming a race in April 2014.[63] She claimed that the drone collided with her and that ""the ambulance crew took a piece of propeller from my head"".[63] The owner of the UAV claimed that the athlete had been injured when she was frightened by the falling UAV and tripped.[63] Timing equipment caused interference with the operation of the UAV while it was close to people on the ground.[64] In November 2014, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions stated that the evidence showed that the drone had crashed into the triathlete, who sustained head injuries as a result. However, taking into account the young age and antecedents of the pilot, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions chose not to proceed with a charge against the operator and handed the matter back to CASA.

recreational drone pilot crashed their drone, a DJI Phantom, during a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in February 2016.[66] No one was injured. The drone reportedly landed near the Memorial's Director and former defence minister Brendan Nelson, who picked it up and subsequently handed it to security staff.[67] Following a Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) investigation, the pilot was fined $900, which, according to a CASA spokesman, closed the matter.[67]"

Creignou was attending a 5K run in Beloeil, Quebec in June 2016 when a DJI Phantom 3 fell and hit her on the head.[68] She was taken to hospital, where she was diagnosed with whiplash.[68] As of 22 June, she was still out of work and had to cancel a holiday with her husband.[68] Rosaire Turcotte, who operated the UAV that crashed, said he couldn't understand how it happened and that he'd acted safely.[68] The incident was caught by a camera on a different UAV, one owned by VTOL-X Drones, a company hired to cover the event.[68] VTOL-X CEO Flavio Martenkowski said he had spoken to Turcotte about the danger of flying so near to a crowd just before the crash.[68] The Transportation Safety Board of Canada opened an investigation into the crash.[68]"

December 2015, a UAV filming a slalom event in Madonna di Campiglio nearly hit Marcel Hirscher.[77] The International Ski Federation had agreed to the use of the UAV, though the pilot was not allowed
