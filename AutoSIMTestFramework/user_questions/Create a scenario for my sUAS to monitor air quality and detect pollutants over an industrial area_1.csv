Create a scenario for my sUAS to monitor air quality and detect pollutants over an industrial area,"Unidentified UAVs were seen flying near 13 nuclear power plants in October and November 2014.[69] The Secretariat-General for National Defence and Security issued a statement that the flights were an ""organized provocation"".[69]---
At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.---
During an aerial survey of a sewage treatment works, the unmanned aircraft flew into a wind 
turbine, the height of which the pilot had misjudged.---
On Day 0, at approximately XA:00, I initiated a drone operation near Location A, with the 
aim of gaining a clearer view of a distant plume of smoke. My primary objective was to 
pinpoint the smoke's origin. I selected a mostly empty parking lot for the flig ht, ensuring 
my drone, a DJI Mini 2 weighing less than 249g, remained within my line of sight 
throughout the operation. Unfortunately, I mistakenly flew the drone to an altitude of 
about 275 feet, unintentionally surpassing the LAANC ceiling of 100 feet de signated for 
Class D airspace. At the time, I was unaware of my presence within this specific airspace. 
The clear midday conditions further compelled me to seek out the source of the smoke 
without realizing the potential violation. I was later contacted by  a local drone pilot and 
informed that my action may have been in violation of the class D airspace. I was the only 
individual manipulating the controls, and no other parties were involved in this operation. 
The breach into the Class D airspace was a direc t result of my lack of awareness about the 
regulations governing that area. After concluding the flight, a local drone enthusiast 
approached me to highlight the potential infringement. Acknowledging this oversight, I am 
now committed to improving my compre hension of UAS regulations. I am determined to 
complete the Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) and will ensure that I procure any 
necessary licenses or certifications before embarking on future recreational drone 
activities. This measure is crucial in pr eventing similar inadvertent breaches in the future.---
I was piloting the UAS. I am in good health. I'm not a smoker. I had a good night's sleep 
and was hydrated. I stood in the middle of the flight area and could easily see the UAS at 
all times. I arrived around XA:00 and walked the area to be mapped and chos e a spot near 
the middle of the mission area that had great visibility to set up home and battery 
exchange point. Conditions: I utilized the Aloft app (v2.2.2.XXXX) stated the flight weather 
as: 64F wind at 7 from North gusting to 17 with visibility greate r than 10. ALOFT showed 
no advisories for the location with a green zero box. Utilizing the DJI pilot app (V2.5.1.XX), 
in mission flight mode. The flight altitude for the mission was 138' AGL of home point. The 
total area of the mission was 32.0 acres and an estimated time of 55m and 1 sec. The 
estimated flight time means that the UAS returns to home point for battery exchange 
about every 15 minutes. How it was noticed: I was watching the UAS and thought it came 
to hover as it finished flying waypoints prio r to returning to the home point. At that point it 
looked down at the controller to see if it was complete and noticed caution that the UAS 
was not connected. I looked up and the UAS was no longer in the air. I walked over and 
found the UAS in the field wi th damage to two arms and approximately 15 feet away I 
found the battery that had expanded and separated on one side of its casing. No battery 
materiel leakage or seepage was visible. It is my belief that the gust wind conditions 
required the UAS to utiliz e increased rate of battery power draw, the battery expanded 
causing the UAS to lose power resulting in an uncontrolled descent/fall from the sky into 
the field. No property was damaged, and no fire occurred. Management was in the final set 
of purchasing a  MAVIC 3 to meet the remote identification requirement and upgrades us 
with multispectral capability. Because of this, management made a decision to utilize the 
approximately $400 repair funds towards the new/upgraded UAS in lieu of repairing the 
Mavic 2."," Scenario 1:
