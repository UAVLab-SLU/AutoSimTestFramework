"Formulate a scenario to test my sUAS in last-mile delivery within a city, focusing on efficient navigation, secure delivery, and handling dynamic obstacles like pedestrians and traffic.","The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.---
During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public.---
While conducting a flight in support of police search operations, the pilot became concerned 
about losing visual line of sight with the unmanned aircraft (UA) and attempted to activate 
the return-to-home (RTH) function.  The UA had not acquired a GPS signal prior to the flight 
and therefore did not record its takeoff point, rendering the RTH function ineffective.  The 
UA lost connection with the controller and drifted in the wind.  It was located undamaged the 
next day approximately 5 km away, having performed an automatic landing.---
At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.---
The UAS, a DJI M600 Pro, was being operated in an automated flight mode to survey a 
construction site when a GPS-compass error caused the aircraft to revert to a flight mode 
that required manual control.  By the time that the pilot and observer realised that it was 
not responding to the return-to-home (RTH) function, visual line of sight was lost when the 
aircraft drifted with the wind beyond a line of trees.  It subsequently collided with the roof of 
a house before falling into the property’s rear garden.  No persons were injured.  
The pilot, and the observer who was also a pilot, had operated UASs since 2018 and had 
the required permissions from the UK CAA.  Both pilots had relied predominantly on the 
automated flight capability of their aircraft and had not, nor were required to have, practised 
for emergencies since completing their flying training in 2018.  One Safety Recommendation 
is made to the UK CAA."," Scenario 1:
