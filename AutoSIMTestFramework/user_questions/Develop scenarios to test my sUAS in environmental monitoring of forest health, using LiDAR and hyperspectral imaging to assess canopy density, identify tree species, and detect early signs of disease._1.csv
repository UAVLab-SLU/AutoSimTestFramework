"Develop scenarios to test my sUAS in environmental monitoring of forest health, using LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging to assess canopy density, identify tree species, and detect early signs of disease.","The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was fitted with a third-party lidar1 pod for its planned 
survey mission which involved flights of around 8 minutes duration.  As it commenced its 
pre-programmed route, it appeared to continue to climb above the 30 m height that had been 
set.  The remote pilots observed that is was too high and attempted to land it immediately.  
The aircraft appeared unresponsive to the remote pilot’s inputs and it then commenced an 
uncontrolled descent, rapidly increasing speed, until it struck the ground.---
After takeoff the unmanned aircraft (UA) experienced winds exceeding the manufacturer’s 
stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the 
UA and ground control unit when it drifted in the high wind over a five-storey building.---
The UAS, a DJI Phantom 4 RTK, was being operated in an automated flight mode to survey 
a railway track and surrounding infrastructure when one of the four propellers detached 
whilst in-flight.  The aircraft rapidly descended from a height of 70 m (230 ft) where it struck 
the ground in the rear garden of a house.  No persons were injured.
This investigation has reviewed the new UAS regulations introduced on 31 December 2020 
concerning the safe overflight of people and data available to assist in risk assessments.  
Two Safety Recommendations are made to the UK CAA.---
During an aerial survey flight, the UAS detected a rapid loss of battery power and initiated 
an immediate automatic landing. Whilst descending, its flight behaviour became erratic, 
control was lost to the remote pilot, and the UA struck an uninvolved person before hitting 
the ground. It was not possible to determine a cause for the loss of battery power or the flight 
behaviour. There may have been an opportunity during flight control checks to consider 
unexpected battery discharge rate as a reason to abort the flight.---
The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures."," Scenario 1:
