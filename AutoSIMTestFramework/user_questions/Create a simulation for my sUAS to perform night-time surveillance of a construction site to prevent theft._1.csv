Create a simulation for my sUAS to perform night-time surveillance of a construction site to prevent theft.,"The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.---
The UA was being flown under contract to carry out aerial camera work around a tall tower 
structure of a seaside tourist attraction in Brighton.  The UA had flown several times around 
and over the top of the tower up to approximately 600 ft agl.  It had completed a shot directly 
above the tower when contact with the controller was lost.  It then descended and hit the top 
of the tower.  Its descent appeared to be under control, but the UA failed to respond to any 
flight commands.  The flight data recorded a loss of link, but the technical cause of the loss 
of control of the UA could not be determined.---
The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.---
The UAS, a DJI M600 Pro, was being operated in an automated flight mode to survey a 
construction site when a GPS-compass error caused the aircraft to revert to a flight mode 
that required manual control.  By the time that the pilot and observer realised that it was 
not responding to the return-to-home (RTH) function, visual line of sight was lost when the 
aircraft drifted with the wind beyond a line of trees.  It subsequently collided with the roof of 
a house before falling into the property’s rear garden.  No persons were injured.  
The pilot, and the observer who was also a pilot, had operated UASs since 2018 and had 
the required permissions from the UK CAA.  Both pilots had relied predominantly on the 
automated flight capability of their aircraft and had not, nor were required to have, practised 
for emergencies since completing their flying training in 2018.  One Safety Recommendation 
is made to the UK CAA.---
During a film shoot involving a large group of actors performing in close proximity to an 
Unmanned Aircraft (UA), an actor deviated from the briefed path and ran into one of the 
UA’s propellers.  The propeller struck him on the back of the neck, but the injuries were 
superficial.  
The CAA’s CAP722 document provides guidance for operating Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
(UAS) in UK airspace but is ambiguous about the UAS operator gaining explicit consent 
from involved third parties for operating in close proximity to a UA.  The CAA has taken 
action to review and amend the guidance. 
The UAS operator and film director have put additional safety measures in place to prevent 
a recurrence."," Scenario 1:
