i want to test temparature and wind components of drone completetly,"The aircraft dropped to the ground from a height of 15 m when power was lost to the electric 
motors even though the battery’s energy level (State of Charge) was 97.7%.  The wind 
conditions were turbulent and an investigation by the Unmanned Aircraft System’s (UAS) 
manufacturer concluded that the probable cause for the power loss was that the battery had 
become loose in flight.---
My Drone was involved in an incident with a flying hot air balloon. My drone was hovering 
under 50 ft while filming guest who where taking a balloon ride before taking off. A flying 
balloon came within few feet of the balloon i was filming causing my drone  to lose control 
and striking a side of the basket from the flying balloon. The incident was inadvertent and 
not deliberate.---
Whilst the unmanned aircraft (UA) was climbing, in hover mode, one of the rear electronic 
speed controllers (ECSs) overheated causing a loss of control of its associated motor and 
propeller.  Control of the aircraft was lost and it fell into a crop field, damaging it beyond 
economical repair.  The manufacturer is looking to re-design the rear propellers to reduce 
the likelihood of the ESCs overheating.---
I was flying in Location A across the street from the park. A hawk came out from hiding in 
the sun and attacked my drone. It was damaged and fell 250 feet. I recovered the parts. 
It looks like it is a complete loss.---
During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public."," Scenario 1:
