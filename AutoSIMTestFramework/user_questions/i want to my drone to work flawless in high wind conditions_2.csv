This JSON object represents a drone simulation environment in a mountainous region with varying altitudes and steep slopes. The wind speed is 8 m/s, affecting flight stability and sensor performance. The temperature is 5°C, potentially affecting battery performance. Lighting conditions are transitioning from daylight to dusk, requiring enhanced reliance on night vision and thermal imaging sensors. GPS signal quality is generally high, but occasional interferences due to mountainous terrain. Altitude varies from ground level (0 meters) to 200 meters, necessitating versatile altitude adjustments to navigate obstacles. Obstacles include steep slopes and rocky terrain, posing potential collision risks. Network/communication quality is weak and intermittent in areas with dense structural damage and under tall mountains.

The sUAS configuration and properties include GPS, high-resolution camera, and environmental sensors. The payload weight is 2.3 kg, including data collection equipment and sensors. The battery life is 45 minutes per flight, requiring efficient planning for data collection and recharging logistics.

The sUAS properties to be tested include maneuverability, durability, stability in low light, and communication range."
