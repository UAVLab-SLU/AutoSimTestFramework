Test my sUAS in a surveillance operation to monitor traffic congestion and report incidents in real-time.,"At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.

The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.---
As the Remote Pilot In Command (RPIC), I was operating a sUAS quadcopter to get photos 
on an open piece of land off the side of the road. It was daytime about midday with clear 
skies. My drone was flying in Class C Airspace without authorization which is a n FAA 
violation. The UAS was about 100 ft up when I realized that the checking of where I was 
and if airspace authorization (would typically use the B4UFLY and Aloft apps) was needed 
was missed in my pre -flight checklist. Upon the realization this step was  missed the drone 
was brought down immediately. After bringing the drone down I checked both B4UFLY and 
Aloft apps and turns out for a brief moment I was flying in class C without authorization. I 
aborted the mission called the client and told them even wi th being able to get LAANC 
auto authorization I would not be getting photos. It should be noted that no one and 
nothing was harmed or involved. No planes were in sight nor were there people flown 
over. After the incident I have reevaluated my pre -flight pl anning to involve a more 
detailed look at the process and rearrange my steps in which I take pre -flight action. With 
the small amount of flight time I have under my belt I am still getting used to everything I 
am supposed to check before flight so to corre ct this I have also revisited my Part 107 
course for a more in depth look at how to have better systems in place to avoid this in the 
future.

The reporter had no additional information to share.---
The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.---
The unmanned air system (UAS) had been used to carry out an aerial search during 
a police operation.  On completion, it was being flown back to the launch point, when, 
without warning, it rapidly spiralled to the ground. It crashed into a small stream and was 
extensively damaged.  An examination of the UAS data after the accident found the cause 
was a propulsion error in one of its four motors.---
During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public."," Scenario 1:
