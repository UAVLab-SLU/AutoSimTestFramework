"Design scenarios to test my sUAS in urban surveillance, focusing on monitoring traffic, identifying suspicious activities, and ensuring secure data transmission while adhering to privacy laws.","The unmanned air system (UAS) had been used to carry out an aerial search during 
a police operation.  On completion, it was being flown back to the launch point, when, 
without warning, it rapidly spiralled to the ground. It crashed into a small stream and was 
extensively damaged.  An examination of the UAS data after the accident found the cause 
was a propulsion error in one of its four motors.---
During a film shoot involving a large group of actors performing in close proximity to an 
Unmanned Aircraft (UA), an actor deviated from the briefed path and ran into one of the 
UA’s propellers.  The propeller struck him on the back of the neck, but the injuries were 
superficial.  
The CAA’s CAP722 document provides guidance for operating Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
(UAS) in UK airspace but is ambiguous about the UAS operator gaining explicit consent 
from involved third parties for operating in close proximity to a UA.  The CAA has taken 
action to review and amend the guidance. 
The UAS operator and film director have put additional safety measures in place to prevent 
a recurrence.---
The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.---
The UA was being flown under contract to carry out aerial camera work around a tall tower 
structure of a seaside tourist attraction in Brighton.  The UA had flown several times around 
and over the top of the tower up to approximately 600 ft agl.  It had completed a shot directly 
above the tower when contact with the controller was lost.  It then descended and hit the top 
of the tower.  Its descent appeared to be under control, but the UA failed to respond to any 
flight commands.  The flight data recorded a loss of link, but the technical cause of the loss 
of control of the UA could not be determined.---
The UAS, a DJI Phantom 4 RTK, was being operated in an automated flight mode to survey 
a railway track and surrounding infrastructure when one of the four propellers detached 
whilst in-flight.  The aircraft rapidly descended from a height of 70 m (230 ft) where it struck 
the ground in the rear garden of a house.  No persons were injured.
This investigation has reviewed the new UAS regulations introduced on 31 December 2020 
concerning the safe overflight of people and data available to assist in risk assessments.  
Two Safety Recommendations are made to the UK CAA."," Scenario 1:
