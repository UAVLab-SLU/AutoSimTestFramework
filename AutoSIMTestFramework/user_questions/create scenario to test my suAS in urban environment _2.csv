This JSON object represents a drone simulation environment in a dense urban area in New York City, with rainy weather, a wind speed of 15 m/s, a temperature of 10째C, and transitioning lighting conditions. The GPS signal quality is generally high, but there are occasional interferences due to tall buildings and underground obstructions. The altitude varies from ground level to 150 meters, and there are obstacles such as power lines, traffic, and other urban infrastructure elements. The sUAS configuration includes GPS, thermal camera, acoustic sensors, and a high-resolution camera, with a payload weight of 2.5 kg and a battery life of 40 minutes per flight. The sUAS properties to be tested include maneuverability, durability, stability in low light, and communication range."
