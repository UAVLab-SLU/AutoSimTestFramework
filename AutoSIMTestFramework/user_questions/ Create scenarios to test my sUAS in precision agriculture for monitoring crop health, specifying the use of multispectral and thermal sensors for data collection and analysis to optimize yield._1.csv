" Create scenarios to test my sUAS in precision agriculture for monitoring crop health, specifying the use of multispectral and thermal sensors for data collection and analysis to optimize yield.","The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.---
At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.---
Whilst the unmanned aircraft (UA) was climbing, in hover mode, one of the rear electronic 
speed controllers (ECSs) overheated causing a loss of control of its associated motor and 
propeller.  Control of the aircraft was lost and it fell into a crop field, damaging it beyond 
economical repair.  The manufacturer is looking to re-design the rear propellers to reduce 
the likelihood of the ESCs overheating.---
After takeoff the unmanned aircraft (UA) experienced winds exceeding the manufacturer’s 
stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the 
UA and ground control unit when it drifted in the high wind over a five-storey building.---
The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was fitted with a third-party lidar1 pod for its planned 
survey mission which involved flights of around 8 minutes duration.  As it commenced its 
pre-programmed route, it appeared to continue to climb above the 30 m height that had been 
set.  The remote pilots observed that is was too high and attempted to land it immediately.  
The aircraft appeared unresponsive to the remote pilot’s inputs and it then commenced an 
uncontrolled descent, rapidly increasing speed, until it struck the ground."," Scenario 1:
