i want to my drone to work flawless in high wind conditions,"After takeoff the unmanned aircraft (UA) experienced winds exceeding the manufacturer’s 
stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the 
UA and ground control unit when it drifted in the high wind over a five-storey building.The aircraft dropped to the ground from a height of 15 m when power was lost to the electric 
motors even though the battery’s energy level (State of Charge) was 97.7%.  The wind 
conditions were turbulent and an investigation by the Unmanned Aircraft System’s (UAS) 
manufacturer concluded that the probable cause for the power loss was that the battery had 
become loose in flight.During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public.My Drone was involved in an incident with a flying hot air balloon. My drone was hovering 
under 50 ft while filming guest who where taking a balloon ride before taking off. A flying 
balloon came within few feet of the balloon i was filming causing my drone  to lose control 
and striking a side of the basket from the flying balloon. The incident was inadvertent and 
not deliberate.I was flying in Location A across the street from the park. A hawk came out from hiding in 
the sun and attacked my drone. It was damaged and fell 250 feet. I recovered the parts. 
It looks like it is a complete loss."," Scenario 1:
