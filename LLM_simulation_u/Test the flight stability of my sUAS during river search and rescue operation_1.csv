Test the flight stability of my sUAS during river search and rescue operation,"As the unmanned aircraft (UA) lifted off from the ship’s helideck it immediately pitched up 
and transited rearwards with insufficient height to clear the 19-cm high gunwale about 2 m 
behind it.  The impact damaged the UA tail structure, leading to a failure of the tail rotor 
transmission and resulting in the UA spiralling into the sea alongside the ship.
Following an investigation by the manufacturer software changes have been made to 
reduce operator workload during the takeoff.During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public.The unmanned air system (UAS) had been used to carry out an aerial search during 
a police operation.  On completion, it was being flown back to the launch point, when, 
without warning, it rapidly spiralled to the ground. It crashed into a small stream and was 
extensively damaged.  An examination of the UAS data after the accident found the cause 
was a propulsion error in one of its four motors.The UA was hovering at between 50 m to 65 m agl during a demonstration flight, when a 
rhythmic, lower than normal sound was heard emanating from the UAS.  It then dipped 
and spiralled downwards during which control could not be re-established.  The UA hit the 
ground and was severely damaged.  A fatigue failure of a blade attachment bolt caused one 
of the lift propeller blades to detach in flight.After takeoff the unmanned aircraft (UA) experienced winds exceeding the manufacturer’s 
stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the 
UA and ground control unit when it drifted in the high wind over a five-storey building."," Scenario 1:
