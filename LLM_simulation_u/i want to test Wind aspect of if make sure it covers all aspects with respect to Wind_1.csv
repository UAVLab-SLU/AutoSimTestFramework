i want to test Wind aspect of if make sure it covers all aspects with respect to Wind,"During an aerial survey of a sewage treatment works, the unmanned aircraft flew into a wind 
turbine, the height of which the pilot had misjudged.The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.The aircraft dropped to the ground from a height of 15 m when power was lost to the electric 
motors even though the battery’s energy level (State of Charge) was 97.7%.  The wind 
conditions were turbulent and an investigation by the Unmanned Aircraft System’s (UAS) 
manufacturer concluded that the probable cause for the power loss was that the battery had 
become loose in flight.Conducting training flight as instructor pilot in an unmanned Aircraft X. Tower weather per 
ATIS was reported as Few clouds 1100 ft. Prior to that, skies had been reported as clear. 
Took off planning on VFR pattern work and found that the clouds had thicke ned and 
pushed in. Decision was made and communicated to tower that we would make a full stop 
landing. VFR cloud clearances were not maintained at times during the pattern. Full stop 
landing was successfully completed after which Tower stated that clouds w ere now Broken 
at 1200 ft. AGL.After takeoff the unmanned aircraft (UA) experienced winds exceeding the manufacturer’s 
stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the 
UA and ground control unit when it drifted in the high wind over a five-storey building."," Scenario 1:
