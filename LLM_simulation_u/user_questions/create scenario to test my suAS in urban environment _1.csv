create scenario to test my suAS in urban environment ,"The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.


During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public.


The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.


The crew was performing a launch of the aircraft and was in the movement portion of the 
taxi out. We perform all of the ground operation on a ramp on the southwest corner of the 
airport at the end of [the] taxiway. The airport has a gate that is blocking t axiway and the 
crew was briefed that this is a non movement area behind the gate on [the] taxi way. We 
began our taxi up to and holding short of the gate remaining outside the movement area 
to our knowledge. Ground asked who approved us to taxi? We briefed  them that we were 
told this was a non movement area and they said that we needed permission to taxi. 
There is no movement lines that we observed and we thought the gate was the boundary 
to the movement area. There should be a clear defined visual boundary  to the movement 
and non movement area.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter indicated ATC did not issue a brasher warning. In the ramp area where the 
UAS is operated there are no markings on the ramp to delineate between the non 
movement area and the movement area. The UAS crew was unfamiliar with the airport 
and ATC provided them with information on how they could safely conduct operations.


The UAS, a DJI M600 Pro, was being operated in an automated flight mode to survey a 
construction site when a GPS-compass error caused the aircraft to revert to a flight mode 
that required manual control.  By the time that the pilot and observer realised that it was 
not responding to the return-to-home (RTH) function, visual line of sight was lost when the 
aircraft drifted with the wind beyond a line of trees.  It subsequently collided with the roof of 
a house before falling into the property’s rear garden.  No persons were injured.  
The pilot, and the observer who was also a pilot, had operated UASs since 2018 and had 
the required permissions from the UK CAA.  Both pilots had relied predominantly on the 
automated flight capability of their aircraft and had not, nor were required to have, practised 
for emergencies since completing their flying training in 2018.  One Safety Recommendation 
is made to the UK CAA."," Scenario 1:
