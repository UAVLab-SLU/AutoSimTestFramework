"Create scenarios to test my sUAS in a search-and-rescue mission, emphasizing locating missing persons, navigating challenging terrains, and providing real-time updates to rescue teams.","The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.---
The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.---
The unmanned air system (UAS) had been used to carry out an aerial search during 
a police operation.  On completion, it was being flown back to the launch point, when, 
without warning, it rapidly spiralled to the ground. It crashed into a small stream and was 
extensively damaged.  An examination of the UAS data after the accident found the cause 
was a propulsion error in one of its four motors.---
The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was fitted with a third-party lidar1 pod for its planned 
survey mission which involved flights of around 8 minutes duration.  As it commenced its 
pre-programmed route, it appeared to continue to climb above the 30 m height that had been 
set.  The remote pilots observed that is was too high and attempted to land it immediately.  
The aircraft appeared unresponsive to the remote pilot’s inputs and it then commenced an 
uncontrolled descent, rapidly increasing speed, until it struck the ground.---
The UAS, a DJI M600 Pro, was being operated in an automated flight mode to survey a 
construction site when a GPS-compass error caused the aircraft to revert to a flight mode 
that required manual control.  By the time that the pilot and observer realised that it was 
not responding to the return-to-home (RTH) function, visual line of sight was lost when the 
aircraft drifted with the wind beyond a line of trees.  It subsequently collided with the roof of 
a house before falling into the property’s rear garden.  No persons were injured.  
The pilot, and the observer who was also a pilot, had operated UASs since 2018 and had 
the required permissions from the UK CAA.  Both pilots had relied predominantly on the 
automated flight capability of their aircraft and had not, nor were required to have, practised 
for emergencies since completing their flying training in 2018.  One Safety Recommendation 
is made to the UK CAA."," Scenario 1:
