Create scenarios to test my sUAS in a search and Rescue Operation,"The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.


The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.


At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.


The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was fitted with a third-party lidar1 pod for its planned 
survey mission which involved flights of around 8 minutes duration.  As it commenced its 
pre-programmed route, it appeared to continue to climb above the 30 m height that had been 
set.  The remote pilots observed that is was too high and attempted to land it immediately.  
The aircraft appeared unresponsive to the remote pilot’s inputs and it then commenced an 
uncontrolled descent, rapidly increasing speed, until it struck the ground.


During an aerial survey flight, the UAS detected a rapid loss of battery power and initiated 
an immediate automatic landing. Whilst descending, its flight behaviour became erratic, 
control was lost to the remote pilot, and the UA struck an uninvolved person before hitting 
the ground. It was not possible to determine a cause for the loss of battery power or the flight 
behaviour. There may have been an opportunity during flight control checks to consider 
unexpected battery discharge rate as a reason to abort the flight."," Scenario 1:
