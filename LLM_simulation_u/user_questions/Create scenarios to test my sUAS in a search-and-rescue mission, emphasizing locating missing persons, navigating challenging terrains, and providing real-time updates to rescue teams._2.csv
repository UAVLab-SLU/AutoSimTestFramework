This JSON object represents a drone simulation environment in a mountainous region with varying elevations, steep cliffs, and dense vegetation. The wind speed is 20 m/s, affecting flight stability and sensor performance. The temperature is 10Â°C, colder than ideal for drone operations, potentially affecting battery efficiency. Overcast skies require reliance on thermal imaging sensors for locating missing persons. The GPS signal quality is moderate, with occasional signal loss due to the mountainous terrain. The altitude varies from ground level (0 meters) to 300 meters, necessitating versatile altitude adjustments to navigate obstacles. Obstacles include steep cliffs, dense vegetation, and potential wildlife. The network/communication quality is moderate, with potential signal loss due to the mountainous terrain.

The sUAS configuration and properties include GPS, Thermal Camera, and Acoustic Sensors. The payload weight is 2.5 kg, including rescue equipment (e.g., first aid kit, communication device) and sensors. The battery life is 40 minutes per flight, requiring efficient planning for search patterns and recharging logistics.

The sUAS properties to be tested include maneuverability, durability, stability in low light, and communication range."
