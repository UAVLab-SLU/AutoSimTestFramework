Generate a mission scenario for my sUAS to perform crop health monitoring using multispectral imaging,"The unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was fitted with a third-party lidar1 pod for its planned 
survey mission which involved flights of around 8 minutes duration.  As it commenced its 
pre-programmed route, it appeared to continue to climb above the 30 m height that had been 
set.  The remote pilots observed that is was too high and attempted to land it immediately.  
The aircraft appeared unresponsive to the remote pilot’s inputs and it then commenced an 
uncontrolled descent, rapidly increasing speed, until it struck the ground.---
At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.

The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.---
The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.---
As the Remote Pilot In Command (RPIC), I was operating a sUAS quadcopter to get photos 
on an open piece of land off the side of the road. It was daytime about midday with clear 
skies. My drone was flying in Class C Airspace without authorization which is a n FAA 
violation. The UAS was about 100 ft up when I realized that the checking of where I was 
and if airspace authorization (would typically use the B4UFLY and Aloft apps) was needed 
was missed in my pre -flight checklist. Upon the realization this step was  missed the drone 
was brought down immediately. After bringing the drone down I checked both B4UFLY and 
Aloft apps and turns out for a brief moment I was flying in class C without authorization. I 
aborted the mission called the client and told them even wi th being able to get LAANC 
auto authorization I would not be getting photos. It should be noted that no one and 
nothing was harmed or involved. No planes were in sight nor were there people flown 
over. After the incident I have reevaluated my pre -flight pl anning to involve a more 
detailed look at the process and rearrange my steps in which I take pre -flight action. With 
the small amount of flight time I have under my belt I am still getting used to everything I 
am supposed to check before flight so to corre ct this I have also revisited my Part 107 
course for a more in depth look at how to have better systems in place to avoid this in the 
future.

The reporter had no additional information to share.---
After takeoff the unmanned aircraft (UA) experienced winds exceeding the manufacturer’s 
stated limitations and was unable to hold its position position.  A culmination of the 
subsequent position warning and automatic attempt to return “home” and land triggered 
a software error, commanding the UA to land while not over its home position.  As the UA 
descended there was a loss of link with the ground control unit and the UA collided with a 
tree.    The loss of signal was probably caused by the loss of radio line of sight between the 
UA and ground control unit when it drifted in the high wind over a five-storey building."," Scenario 1:
