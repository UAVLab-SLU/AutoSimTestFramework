This JSON object represents a drone simulation environment in a coastal area in Florida, with sunny weather, a wind speed of 10 m/s, a temperature of 30째C, and transitioning lighting conditions from daylight to sunset. The GPS signal quality is generally high, but there are occasional interferences due to tall buildings and underground obstructions. The altitude varies from ground level to 100 meters, and there are obstacles such as power lines, boats, and other coastal infrastructure elements. The network/communication quality is generally strong and stable, with minimal interferences.

The sUAS configuration and properties include GPS for navigation and location tracking, a thermal camera for detecting heat signatures of vehicles, and acoustic sensors to detect sounds indicating the presence of incidents. The payload weight is 2.5 kg, including surveillance equipment and sensors. The battery life is 60 minutes per flight, requiring efficient planning for search patterns and recharging logistics.

The sUAS properties to be tested include maneuverability, durability, stability in low light, and communication range."
