This JSON object represents a drone simulation environment for a night-time surveillance mission at a construction site in downtown Chicago. The wind direction is northeast, and the wind speed is 5 m/s. The origin coordinates are 41.8781° latitude and -87.6362° longitude, with a height of 0 meters. The time of day is 22:00:00 (10:00 PM). The environment uses geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and height) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for simulation.

The monitors in this environment include a circular deviation monitor with a parameter of 10 meters, a collision monitor with no parameters, a point deviation monitor with a parameter of 10 meters, a minimum separation distance monitor with parameters of 10 meters and 1 meter, a landspace monitor with a parameter of 41.8781° latitude and -87.6362° longitude, and a no-fly zone monitor with a polygon defined by three points: 41.8781° latitude and -87.6362° longitude, 41.8781° latitude and -87.6362° longitude, and 41.8781° latitude and -87.6362° longitude. The wind monitor has a parameter of 0.5."
