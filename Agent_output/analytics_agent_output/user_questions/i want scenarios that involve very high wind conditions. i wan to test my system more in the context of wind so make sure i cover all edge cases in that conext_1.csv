i want scenarios that involve very high wind conditions. i wan to test my system more in the context of wind so make sure i cover all edge cases in that conext,"During an aerial survey of a sewage treatment works, the unmanned aircraft flew into a wind 
turbine, the height of which the pilot had misjudged.The unmanned aircraft (UA) was surveying a foreshore close to a construction site using a 
flight plan of pre-programmed waypoints.
During the flight the UA was affected by a change in the wind that resulted in it flying larger 
than normal turns.  This caused the UA to overshoot its downwind waypoints and fly over the construction site.  During one such overshoot the UA began to descend, as programmed, and collided with a crane on the construction site about 250 m inland.
As a result of this accident the operator made several changes to its procedures.During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public.Conducting training flight as instructor pilot in an unmanned Aircraft X. Tower weather per 
ATIS was reported as Few clouds 1100 ft. Prior to that, skies had been reported as clear. 
Took off planning on VFR pattern work and found that the clouds had thicke ned and 
pushed in. Decision was made and communicated to tower that we would make a full stop 
landing. VFR cloud clearances were not maintained at times during the pattern. Full stop 
landing was successfully completed after which Tower stated that clouds w ere now Broken 
at 1200 ft. AGL.Whilst hovering at a height of about 50 m over a building, one of the propeller motor 
electronic speed controllers failed, causing the aircraft to drop vertically and crash into the 
roof of the building."," Scenario 1:
