"Generate Scenario to Test  my sUAS for city surveillance 
","At XA:09 Day 0 was a near miss between a crewed aircraft and my sUAS I was Remote 
Pilot In Command (RPIC) flying above myself and my visual observer and out at 350 ft. 
AGL by around 500 ft. to the west. Upon hearing the engine of an aircraft from the north , I 
began to bring my aircraft in to land as to give way for the crewed aircraft. My sUAS was 
not descending as fast as normal (it may have only felt like it is descending slower). I did 
hear the engine of the crewed aircraft change in pitch as well as saw  a course change. 
After landing and observing the flight path of the crewed aircraft which seemed to be en -
route to land at ZZZ, I powered down my equipment and started trying to find out how to 
report the near miss. Could not find correct contact informat ion for ZZZ ATC to report. At 
time of flight and near miss, no active TFR's or NOTAM's in place.  
Callback: 1  
The reporter learned during post flight review this wasn't a near miss. There was more 
than 1000 feet of vertical and lateral separation between the UAS and the fixed wing 
aircraft.---
The UAS was being used in a police operation over an abandoned building near a public car 
park and train station.  During hover over the building the aircraft’s motors stopped and the 
aircraft fell vertically with no prior warning to the remote pilot.  The aircraft struck the roof of 
the building and the battery separated.  Recorded data indicated that the battery probably 
disconnected in flight.  This could have been caused by the battery not having been fully 
latched prior to takeoff, or the latching mechanism or battery being worn from repeated use 
resulting in an in-flight disconnection.  The operator has taken safety action to remind their 
pilots of the importance of pre-flight checks and checking airframe and battery condition at 
their base.---
The UA was being flown under contract to carry out aerial camera work around a tall tower 
structure of a seaside tourist attraction in Brighton.  The UA had flown several times around 
and over the top of the tower up to approximately 600 ft agl.  It had completed a shot directly 
above the tower when contact with the controller was lost.  It then descended and hit the top 
of the tower.  Its descent appeared to be under control, but the UA failed to respond to any 
flight commands.  The flight data recorded a loss of link, but the technical cause of the loss 
of control of the UA could not be determined.---
I am a wedding videographer who was filming a wedding at the stadium on Day 0. I had 
checked the sectional chart prior to take off and my interpretation was that the stadium 
was outside of the class C airspace for ZZZ. So I proceeded as normal and began my  flight 
with my UAS. The app also did not inform me that I was within in sort of controlled 
airspace and allowed me to take off as normal. I flew for approximately 8 minutes in and 
around the stadium, capturing video for the wedding couple. After I conclud ed my flight I 
was informed by the event staff that the police had been notified and they had came over 
to stop me for flying. I was then informed that I was not permitted to fly because of the 
helicopter pads nearby for the hospitals. After that, I later figured out that the stadium is 
also indeed right on the edge of the class C airspace for ZZZ. Going forward I now am 
totally aware of the airspace occupying the stadium and will no longer conduct any UAS 
operations without prior authorization.---
During a public display of 400 synchronised unmanned aircraft (UA), several were seen 
to deviate briefly from their pre-programmed position.  Shortly afterwards, two UA fell to 
the ground and sustained damage.  It is likely the deviation was caused by a gust of wind 
resulting in two UA colliding and losing control.  The safety zone put in place on the ground 
by the operator and organiser mitigated any risk to the public."," Scenario 1:
