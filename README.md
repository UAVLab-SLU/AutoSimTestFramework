# Supplementaty Material for Replication and Future Research

## Data collected and processed to build the AutoSimTest Framework

### S-Agent Knowledge Base 
sUAS incident data collected from multiple sources and used to construct the knowledge base of the S-agent can be accessed here: [S-Agent Knowledge Base](AutoSIMTestFramework/knowledga_base.csv)

### A-Agent Knowledge Base
Data collected and used to build the knowledge-base of Analytics Agent can be found [here](Px4-Flight-Controller-Params)


## Data prepared to analyze the agents of the AutoSimTest Framework

### Px4 Flight Logs Prepared to analyze Anlaytics-Agent
These flight logs were generated by injecting failures in the PX4 flight controller. The logs were used to analyze the performance of the Analytics-Agent. Please access the flight logs here: [Failure Injected Flight Logs](FlightLogs-FailureInjection). The code developed to simulate run-time sensor errors during Simulation can be found [here](SuT/px4/standalone)

### Model-Based Design of Mission inputs for 5 different sUAS use-cases
The mission inputs were generated using the model-based design approach for 5 different sUAS use-cases. The mission inputs can be accessed [here](Sample-of-Expected-Output/Mission-Samples-For-Each-Use-Case). This data was used to analyze whether the Mission-Agent can generate correct mission inputs for different sUAS use-cases.


### Implementation of Px4 and Ardupilot based SuT.
We designed our own System-Under-Tests. The implementation of these SuT can be found [here](SuT). We tested our SuT using the AutoSimTest Framework. 

Sample of Expected Mission Input by Px4 can be found [here - Missing at the moment]()

Sample of Airsim Settings to execute a Px4 Mission can be found [here](SuT/px4/airsim-setting-sample.json)

Sample of Expected Mission Input by Ardupilot can be found [here - Missing at the moment]()

Sample of Aurdupilot-Sitl Simulator input can be found here [here - Missing at the moment]()

#### Instructions to run the SuT

## Data generated by the AutoSimTest Framework

### Scenarios Generated by S-Agent acros 5 sUAS use-case
The scenarios generated by the S-Agent across 5 sUAS use-cases can be accessed [here](Analysis/Generalizability/S-Agent-Scenario.xlsx)

### Mission and Environment Config Files generated by the Mission and Environment Agents across the 5 Use-Cases
- Json Generated by M-Agent for 25 scenarios [here](Agent_output/mission_json)
- Json Generated by Env-Agent for 25 Scenarios  [here](Agent_output/Environment_json)

### Analytics Report Generated by the Analytics-Agent
- Report Generated by Analytics Agent [here](Agent_output/analytics_agent_output) 

# AutoSimTestFramework - Impementation and Set-up Details

### AUTOSIMTEST Framework Codebase

The implementation of the AutoSimTest Framework including all Agents and communication between then is available here [AutoSimTestFramework](https://github.com/UAVLab-SLU/AutoSimTestFramework/tree/main/AutoSIMTestFramework) for replication and further research and analysis.

### AutoSimTestFramework Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the AUTOSIMTEST Framework Codebase.

---

## Prerequisites
- Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- Ensure you have Python installed and available in your system PATH.

---

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UAVLab-SLU/AutoSimTestFramework.git
   cd AutoSimTestFramework/AutoSimTestFramework
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   conda create -n autosim_env python=3.8
   conda activate autosim_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Running the Framework

1. **Run the Flask Backend**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Run the Gradio Frontend** 
   - Launch the Gradio-based frontend for communicating with the S-Agent, Env-Agent, and M-Agent

   ```bash
   python frontend2.py
   ```

   **Run the Gradio Frontend**  
   - Launch the Gradio-based frontend for communicating with Analytics-Agent

   ```bash
   python Analytics_Agent_front_end.py
   ```
