# Supplementaty Material for Replication and Future Research

## Data collected and processed to build the AutoSimTest Framework

### S-Agent Knowledge Base 
sUAS incident data collected from multiple sources and used to construct the knowledge base of the S-agent can be accessed here: [Go to AutoSIMTestFramework-->knowledge_base.csv](AutoSIMTestFramework/knowledga_base.csv)

### A-Agent Knowledge Base
Data collected and used to build the knowledge-base of Analytics Agent can be found [here]([Go to Px4-Flight-Controller-Params](Px4-Flight-Controller-Params/)


## Data prepared to analyze the agents of the AutoSimTest Framework

### Px4 Flight Logs Prepared to analyze Anlaytics-Agent
These flight logs were generated by injecting failures in the PX4 flight controller. The logs were used to analyze the performance of the Analytics-Agent. Please access the flight logs here:
 
- [Go to FlightLogs-FailureInjection → ](FlightLogs-FailureInjection/)  


  
The code developed to simulate run-time sensor errors during Simulation can be found [Go to SuT → px4 → standalone](SuT/px4/standalone/)

### Model-Based Design of Mission Inputs for 5 Different sUAS Use-Cases

The mission inputs were generated using the model-based design approach for 5 different sUAS use-cases. The mission inputs can be accessed [Go to Sample-of-Expected-Output → Mission-Samples-For-Each-Use-Case](Sample-of-Expected-Output/Mission-Samples-For-Each-Use-Case/). This data was used to analyze whether the Mission-Agent can generate correct mission inputs for different sUAS use-cases.



### Implementation of Px4 and Ardupilot based SuT.

We designed our own System-Under-Tests. The implementation of these SuTs can be found [Go to SuT](SuT/). We tested our SuT using the AutoSimTest Framework.

[Go to Analysis → Feasibility → Px4_SuT → Autonomous_Navigation → missions.json](Analysis/Feasibility/Px4_SuT/Autonomous_Navigation/missions.json) (Sample of Expected Mission Input by Px4)  

[Go to SuT → px4 → airsim-setting-sample.json](SuT/px4/airsim-setting-sample.json) (Sample of Airsim Settings to execute a Px4 Mission)  

[Go to Analysis → Feasibility → Ardu_SuT → Autonomous_Navigation → missions.json](Analysis/Feasibility/Ardu_SuT/Autonomous_Navigation/missions.json) (Sample of Expected Mission Input by Ardupilot)  

[Go to Analysis → Feasibility → Ardu → Waypoint_Navigation → environment.json](Analysis/Feasibility/Ardu/Waypoint_Navigation/environment.json) (Sample of Ardupilot-Sitl Simulator Input)

## Data Generated by the AutoSimTest Framework

### Scenarios Generated by S-Agent Across 5 sUAS Use-Cases
[Go to Analysis → Generalizability → S-Agent-Scenario.xlsx](Analysis/Generalizability/S-Agent-Scenario.xlsx)  

### Mission and Environment Config Files Generated by the Mission and Environment Agents Across the 5 Use-Cases
- [Go to Agent_output → mission_json](Agent_output/mission_json/) (JSON Generated by M-Agent for 25 scenarios)  
- [Go to Agent_output → Environment_json](Agent_output/Environment_json/) (JSON Generated by Env-Agent for 25 scenarios)

### Analytics Report Generated by the Analytics-Agent

# AutoSimTestFramework - Impementation and Set-up Details

### AUTOSIMTEST Framework Codebase

The implementation of the AutoSimTest Framework including all Agents and communication between then is available here [Go to AutoSimTestFramework](AutoSIMTestFramework/) for replication and further research and analysis.

### AutoSimTestFramework Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the AUTOSIMTEST Framework Codebase.

---

## Prerequisites
- Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- Ensure you have Python installed and available in your system PATH.

---

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UAVLab-SLU/AutoSimTestFramework.git
   cd AutoSimTestFramework/AutoSimTestFramework
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   conda create -n autosim_env python=3.8
   conda activate autosim_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Running the Framework

1. **Run the Flask Backend**  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Run the Gradio Frontend** 
   - Launch the Gradio-based frontend for communicating with the S-Agent, Env-Agent, and M-Agent

   ```bash
   python frontend2.py
   ```

   **Run the Gradio Frontend**  
   - Launch the Gradio-based frontend for communicating with Analytics-Agent

   ```bash
   python Analytics_Agent_front_end.py
   ```
